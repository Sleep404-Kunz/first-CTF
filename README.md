# First-CTF

My first ever CTF challenge (ISC2). This was a level-easy CTV developed by members of the ISC2 Toronto Chapter. It was a really good hands on exercise to test my pentesting skills. This was also where I learned pentesting and hacking is more about researching the tools and how to use them and not just typing out commands in a terminal. The objective of the CTF was 2 layered, the first to get a foothold in the target and the second to gain access to files through prvilege escalation. 

## Tools used 

| Tool       | Purpose            |
|------------|--------------------|
| Kali VM    | Used as the attacking machine and also contains the docker instances for the CTF.                 |
| Docker     | Used to deploy the CTF challenge.                                                                 |
| NMAP       | Network scanning tool to identify the open ports in the target hosts.                  |
| Gobuster   | Enumerate hidden directories, URLs, and files  in the target domain.                   |
| nano       | Used as a means for privilege escalation.                   |
