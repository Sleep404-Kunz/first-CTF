# First-CTF üìù

My first ever CTF challenge (ISC2). This was a level-easy CTV developed by members of the ISC2 Toronto Chapter. It was a really good hands on exercise to test my pentesting skills. This was also where I learned pentesting and hacking is more about researching the tools and how to use them and not just typing out commands in a terminal. The objective of the CTF was 2 layered, the first to get a foothold in the target and the second to gain access to files through prvilege escalation. 

- **CTF Name**: privisc2alation
- **Challenge Category**: Category like Web Exploitation
- **Challenge Difficulty**: Easy
- **Objective**: Identify vulnerable ports and gain initial foothold and collect flag 1. After gaining access execute privilege escalation to superuser to collect flag 2.
